## Abstract

The study, "Zamboanga Peninsula Polytechnic State University – School of Business Administration Simulation and Training Hotel Management System," addresses the gap in practical training for Bachelor of Science in Hospitality Management students. Utilizing the Spiral Model methodology, the researchers developed a simulation-based system featuring modules for reservation management, check-in/check-out processes, billing, guest records, transaction histories, user management, room management, and settings management. This innovative platform bridges the gap between theory and practice, providing students with an immersive learning experience that prepares them with essential industry skills.

### Key Features:
- Reservation Management
- Check-In/Check-Out Processes
- Billing System
- Guest Records Management
- Transaction Histories
- User Management
- Room Management
- Settings Management

Testing involved the Computer System Usability Questionnaire (CSUQ), where experts and users rated the system:
- **Alpha Testing (IT Experts)**: Usability (6.5), Information Quality (6.4), Interface Quality (6.6)
- **Beta Testing (Teachers)**: Usability (6.8), Interface Quality (6.5)
- **Student Feedback**: Perfect scores of 7 across all aspects, indicating outstanding satisfaction.

The system proves effective in enhancing experiential learning and preparing students for professional roles. The recommendation is to integrate it into the curriculum and explore further improvements in collaboration with industry stakeholders.
